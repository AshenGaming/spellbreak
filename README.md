# Spellbreak
*A Minecraft 1.12.2 Modpack about Magic*

-----

*This pack is currently in development. It is not in a ready-to-release state yet.*

 

Spellbreak is a magical-themed roleplay pack designed to have an overarching storyline, quest progression, and new gameplay experiences that you may not have had before!

 

There is very little technology in this pack, and the technology that is in it is almost certainly magical. My goal with this pack was to provide a magical gameplay experience with a lot of hidden lore, storylines to follow and adventures to take on!

 

You'll be venturing through various dimensions, interacting with all different types of magic, from your usual thaumaturgy to spell creation!

 

At the beginning of your adventure, you may notice something strange with the world you have found yourself in... Maybe you should take a look at that book you have, and see if you can gather any clues...
